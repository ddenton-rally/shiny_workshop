# Shiny Workshop

## What is Shiny?
Shiny is a new package from RStudio that makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web applications with R

For an introduction and live examples , visit the [Shiny homepage](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny) 

## Why do I like it?

#### Some cool features: 
* Build useful web applications with only a few lines of code - no javaScript required
* Shiny applications are automatically 'live' in the same way that **spreadsheets** are live. Outputs change instantly as users modify inputs, without requiring a reload of the browser."),
* Go to [http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/lessons/Intro/] for more fun tutorials and to see where I learned to make this")
